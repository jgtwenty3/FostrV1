Fostr

Fostr in its' current form is a dadtabase management system for animal shelters and rescues as well as a site for users to browse(and hopefully adopt/foster) animals. 

For shelters and rescues, it allows you to add, edit, and manage your intake and flow of animals. Eventually, I'd like to add in features for chat/messaging, custom forms, and more. 

For users, they can currently browse animal cards, but my goal will be to build almost a social element to keep them engaged and allow them to inquire about adopting and fostering animals from their feed. 

Installation instructions

This application is built with React on the front end with Python/Flask, SQL on the back end. 

To install, fork and clone this repo. Navigate to the server file in the Fostr directory. 

Run pipenv install

Run pipenv shell 

Run python app.py

In another terminal, navigate to the client folder. 

Run npm install

Navigate to the public folder

Run npm start

Both sides should be running from here! 

Users can sign up as new accounts, or login if they currenly have an account set up. 

For admin accounts, they can manage and edit animal information. For users, they can browse the feed. 


Troubleshooting and next steps:

Need to fine tune existing user flow, fix and add chat/messaging functionality, add to user side.
